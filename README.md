# Employee Management Application (React)

This project is a simple Employee Management Application built with React. It allows users to add new employees through a controlled form and dynamically displays the employee list on the screen.

The main purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate core React concepts such as state management, controlled components, props, and component-based architecture.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

In this application:

- Users can enter an employee's full name into a form.
- The form uses controlled inputs managed with React state.
- When the form is submitted, the new employee is added to the main state.
- The employee list automatically updates and re-renders.
- The application demonstrates state lifting from child to parent components.

This project focuses on understanding how data flows in React applications.
